# 3-Malware-Threat-Intel: Tracing Red Stealer (MITRE ATT&CK T1560)

## Project Overview
As a Threat Intelligence analyst, this project involved performing **Malware Analysis** on an executable linked to the **Red Stealer** (also known as RECORDSTEALER) campaign. The objective was to extract critical **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** and map the attacker's activities to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to aid the Incident Response team.

## Key Investigation Steps

| Step | Technique / Tool Used | Outcome / Findings |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | OSINT Analysis (VirusTotal) | Determined the malware category (Trojan) and the file name (`Wextract`). |
| **2** | Command & Control (C2) Identification | Extracted the C2 server IP and port (`77.91.124.55:19071`) used for exfiltration. |
| **3** | MITRE ATT&CK Mapping | Successfully mapped the malware's data preparation phase to **T1560: Archive Collected Data** (specifically, compression). |
| **4** | Detection Rule Extraction (YARA) | Located the relevant **YARA signature** (`detect_Redline_Stealer`) from MalwareBazaar for proactive detection on endpoints. |

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

* **Threat Intelligence (OSINT):** Proficient use of public intelligence platforms (VirusTotal, ThreatFox, MalwareBazaar).
* **Malware Analysis:** Identifying C2 infrastructure, file aliases, and historical activity.
* **MITRE ATT&CK:** Applying framework knowledge to categorize and document attacker TTPs.
* **Proactive Defense:** Extracting signatures (YARA) and IOCs for immediate security control enforcement.
